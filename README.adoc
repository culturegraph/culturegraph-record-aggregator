A library that uses link:https://github.com/marc4j/marc4j[marc4j] to aggregate MARC21 records into a single record.

== Introduction

The CultureGraph project produces groups of records that could be identified by
comparing them using a rule based matching procedure.

The library targets the export of those identified records into a single record.

== Procedure

Assuming a collection of records as input:

* For each record _r_
1. Add the data field 035 (contains a field link _fl_)
2. Mark each data field (exclude field _link:http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd883.html[883]_) in _r_ with the field link _fl_

* Collect all data fields from all records
1. Re-Enumerate all field links (ascending order)
2. Create a blank record _b_
** Set build number as control number (control field 001)
** Set pre-defined cataloging agency (control field 003)
3. Add all data fields to _b_
4. Return _b_
